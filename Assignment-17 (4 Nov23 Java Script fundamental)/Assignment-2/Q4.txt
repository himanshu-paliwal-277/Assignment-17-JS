Q4. Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important?

Precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are present in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are executed first. For example, in the expression 3 + 5 * 2, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so the multiplication is performed first.

Understanding precedence and associativity is important for several reasons:

1. Understanding the order of precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly, preventing potential errors or unexpected results.

2. When working with complex expressions, knowing the precedence and associativity allows developers to write code that behaves as intended, making it easier to reason about and maintain.

3. In case of unexpected results, knowing operator precedence and associativity helps in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues.

4. Knowledge of precedence and associativity can be used to optimize code by avoiding
unnecessary parentheses and ensuring efficient computation.
