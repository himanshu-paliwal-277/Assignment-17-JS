Q2. Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.

JavaScript operator based on their functionality :

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison operators
4. Logical operators

1. Arithmetic Operators : 

Used to perform Arithmetic operation -
Addition operator (+) : let sum = 5 + 2
Subtraction operator (-) : let diff = 4 - 3
Multiplication operator (*) : let product = 2 * 2
Division operator (/) : let div = 4 / 2
Modulo operator (%) : let rem = 9 % 2 [it returns the remender]
Exponentiation operator (**) : let pow = 2 ** 5


2. Assignment Operators :
Used to perform Assignment operation and Assignment value from left to right 
{= , += , -= , *= , /= , %=}
Assignment operator (=) : let num = 4
Addition Assignment operator (+=) : num += 2
Substraction Assignment operator (-=) : num -= 2
Multiplication Assignment operator (*=) : num *= 2
Division Assignment operator (/=) : num /= 2
Modulo Assignment operator (%=) : num %= 2

3. Comparison operators :
Used to Compare to variable in a program {== , != , > , < , >= , <=}
Equal to (==) : num1 == num2
Not Equal to (!=) : num1 != num2
Greater than (>) : num1 > num2
Less than (<) : num1 < num2
Greater than equal to (>=) : num1 >= num2
Less than equal to (<=) : num1 <= num2

4. Logical operators : 
Used to perform Logical operation in a program {&& , || , !}
Logical AND (&&) : true && true
Logical OR (||) : true || false
Logical NOT (!) : !true
