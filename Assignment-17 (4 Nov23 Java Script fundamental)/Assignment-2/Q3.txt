Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Unary operators: 
which require one operand. Examples 

1. Unary Plus (+)
2. Unary Negation (-)
3. Logical NOT (!)
4. TypeOf Operator
5. Increment (++) and Decrement (--)
6. Bitwise NOT (~)

1. Arithmetic Operators { + , - , * , / , % , ** }
2. Assignment Operators { = , += , -= , *= , /= }
3. Comparison Operators { == , != , >= , <= , === , !== , < , > }
