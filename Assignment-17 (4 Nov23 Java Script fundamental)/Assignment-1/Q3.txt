Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

JavaScript five primitive data types :

1. Number: 
The number data type represents numeric values. It can include integers, floating-point numbers, and special values like NaN (Not-a-Number) and Infinity. For example:

let integerNumber = 42;
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14;
let notANumber = NaN;
let positiveInfinity = Infinity;

2. String:
The string data type represents sequences of characters enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `) quotes. Strings are used to represent text data. For example:
let name = "Rahul";
let message = 'Hello';
let str = `My name is ${name}`;

3. Boolean:
The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical values. Booleans are commonly used for conditions and comparisons. For example:

let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let isDataValid = false;

4. Null:
The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been explicitly set to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values. For example:

let address = null;

5. Undefined
The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is often the initial value of variables. For example:

let Name; // Name is undefined
