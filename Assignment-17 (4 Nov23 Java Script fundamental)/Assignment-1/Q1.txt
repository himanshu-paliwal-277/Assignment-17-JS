Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.


JavaScript is a high-level programming language. JavaScript is used in web development. It is used to give the dynamic behavior to website. Its role is to enhance web pages by adding interactivity and dynamic behavior. JavaScript runs directly in web browsers, allowing developers to create features such as form validation, animations, and real-time updates.

JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the webpage's structure. This interaction enables developers to manipulate and modify webpage content, styles, and layout in response to user actions. JavaScript also handles events, making it possible to create interactive web applications. Also JavaScript is used in backend development.
